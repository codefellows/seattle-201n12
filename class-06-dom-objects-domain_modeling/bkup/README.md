# Assignment Overview: Lab 6

In class, we learned how to model an entity in JavaScript using objects. Now, it's your turn to start building an application that models the problem domain in the support doc linked in *Helpful Resources*.

You will also simultaneously be working with more specific style and design concepts through this assignment.

*Before writing a single line of code, be sure that you have a new repository (with a README!) called cookie-stand, and do your work in that directory. Each day you'll be working in separate branches. Once the repo is initialized and set up today, switch to a new branch for your work. Branch names can be whatever you want; it is suggested that you use some sort of standard organization such as `day-feature` for the branch name, such as `tue-models`. **Remember that there is a guide to setting up repos for this course in the Day 2 directory.***

Include in your repository a `.eslintrc.json` file whose contents are copied from the `eslintrc.json` file in the class repository.

### User Stories (MVP)
 - As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business
 - As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information
 - As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand

### Technical Requirements
 - New repository properly set up with a license and README, and cloned to local machine
 - Working on a non-master branch, with regular commit history
 - Good use of Object Literals **(no constructors allowed today)**; one for each store model; properties/values and methods are correctly constructed and given meaningful names
 - Main page meets requirements of the problem domain
 - Use template literals in your JS logic to render the stores as lists on the sales page

### User Stories (Stretch... only after completing everything above)
 - As a developer, I want to make some headway on the public-facing page for the business
