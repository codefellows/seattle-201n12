# Student Comments from Week 1

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- Code demos and code reviews. Seeing other people approach the same problem with a different technique or thought process is beneficial.

- The coding, directed group activities where we get to know each other.

- The individual work times and lab demos! having breaks and time to digest everything.

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- Honestly, the journal and reading assignments. I'm taking the night classes because I have a full time job and a family; the required comments on the reading and the journal seem like busy work to me and I have an extremely limited amount of time as it is.

- The career development starting assignments including LinkedIn and resume building, I think were too soon in the course - happening in the first week.


### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

- Make Github and Canvas work better together.

- Just for me being a beginner at coding I found it hard to follow along when using the terminal due to me lacking experience and knowledge but im so glad the lecture is recorded that helps me a lot to go over the lecture and follow along at my own pace

- etc.
