# Paired lab
## Create a webpage from a provided design comp

In lab today you will be building a single webpage based off of the provided design comp assets. This assignment is a lot of HTML and CSS, and not as much JS as we've been doing this week. In fact, you may choose to do this project with no JS at all, or just add some as a finishing touch.

In this paired project you may do all of the work on one person's laptop if you choose. You can use the other laptop however you want: a reference to look things up, or as a second computer in the project to do some of the coding. Whatever works best for you... it's up to your pair to **plan** and implement your workflow. You are not obligated to use the driver/navigator model of pair programming, since ultimately you'll be submitting a link to a single repo.

If you want to do simultaneous coding on both computers, you could have one person set up a GitHub repo, and then the other person will fork and clone that repo. Don't forget to work on branches if you take this approach! You'll also want to take care to avoid working on the same segments of code at the same time. A little **planning** goes a long way.

Alternately, to the fork-n-clone approach, you can do this: have one person set up the repo, then go into the 'Settings' tab on the repo and add the other person as a collaborator. In this setup each person has equal privileges to push and merge and manage the repo. This is the way your teams will work during Project Week, so perhaps you'd want to try that meow to get a feel for it? It's up to you.

**GitHub Repository & Project Setup**

Create a new repository, either with 'git init' and connecting it to GitHub, or by cloning a repository from GitHub. Decide on either the fork-n-clone or collaborator approach if you are **planning** to both code.

**Assignment Overview**

The assets (Base design comp and images) can be found in the adjacent ***lab-assets*** directory in this repo. Download these files and move the assets into your repo. The file "*PREVIEW" contains an image of what you are striving to build in HTML and CSS, so be sure to open it up and keep it handy... ***but note that it is not for actual use on the page.*** You'll also be provided a couple of paper copies of this image... it is suggested you use it to mark up and sketch out page structure and identify where the image assets need to be placed.

All of the other image files are assets you will need to realize the design comp. It will be useful to make an inventory of them and where they will go on the page... but how you choose to manage and organize this inventory is up to you and your partner's resourcefulness. It's best if you have a **plan** for how you'll manage this.

Suggestion: set up your work directory like this:

* index.html
* style.css
* app.js *(if you choose to use JS)*
* img/   *(a directory that contains all of your image assets)*

If you want to rename any of the image files, feel free to do so. The same goes for pretty much anything else you come up with as a way to do the work.

**Requirements**

Use good HTML structure to scaffold this site. Up to this point, your sites have not required container elements to manage the structure, and ultimately the style. Container elements (a box outside of your content box that might contain multiple content boxes) are very useful in managing layout. You will need to think about the relationship between parent and child / descendant elements as well as the order in which you place them in the HTML. Keep in mind that you can use *display: inline* in your CSS to force block elements, which would ordinarily stack, to sit side-by-side.

Use CSS to style the page to reflect the full comp image provided. Use what knowledge you have at this point (and any resources you are able to understand and use effectively from other sources) to style your site as closely to the design comp as you can. You have the resources and are aware of online tools which will help you find useful solutions! ***There's some pieces of this that will be new to you... use your combined brainpower to find a solution.*** On a project like this, something that finishes the basic task is the goal... it can always be refactored with better design and code later. There are no right or wrong answers... just do your best.

OPTIONAL: Add some JavaScript functionality! Get creative, but make sure the style is complete before moving onto any additional features.
