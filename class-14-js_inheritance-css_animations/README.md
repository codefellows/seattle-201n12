## Project Ideas

### Project Selection Process

We'll discuss your project pitches (from the Canvas assignment) today and tomorrow. Teams may pick any one of the projects they want to build, or, teams/individuals can conjure additional pitches. You'll spend lab time tomorrow afternoon finalizing project selection and then brainstorming and planning on it.

**Q: Is it OK if multiple teams select the samee project?**

**A:** Yep.

**Q: Can teams come up with a new project idea and pivot to it over the weekend?**

**A:** Only with Nicholas's approval, which should be done via a direct message in Slack. Note that Nicholas is generally not on Slack a lot on weekends. Some, but not a lot, but usually responds within a few hours.

### Project Plan Review

On Monday morning, before noon, each team will meet with the instructional staff and review each team's project plan. Your plans should be very detailed, including site architecture,  wireframes of your pages, diagrams of how you are going to organize and solve your problem domain in code (including all points for user input and what the handlers for each of those points will do), plus anything else that you've worked out in advance (naming conventions for variables, for instance, plus things like Git process, branch/issue names, color palettes, custom font selections, whatever goes into the project.) This must be captured in some kind of documentation, whether electronic docs or paper docs (handwritten is fine!). What is NOT acceptable is a photo of some stuff scribbled on a whiteboard.

**Q: Can we start writing code over the weekend?**

**A:** NO. The only exception is if there is need to create a technical proof-of-concept, and that exception must be recommended and/or approved by Nicholas.

**Q: What format should our project plans be in?**

**A:** Google Docs is a good way to collaborate on text-based content like lists, outlines, descriptions, etc. There is also a cool site called GitHub that you can investigate. For wireframes, hand-sketched documents are fine. There are computer-based wireframe tools, but then there is the headache of learning the tool. Whatever you are comfortable working with, that is the way to go.
