  <h1>CSS Transforms and Animations Demo</h1>

  <h2>CSS Transforms</h2>
  <p id="one"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform?v=b">MDN</a>: "The CSS transform property lets you modify the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model. Using it, elements can be translated, rotated, scaled, and skewed."</p>
  <p id="two">As with pretty much everything in the browser, you can have CSS transorms occur on page load, or, place them in an event handler so that they occur following some time of user interaction.</p>
  <p id="three">Clearly, you can do some wacky stuff, but it may not be the most useful.</p>
  <button id="button1">Click here to toggle the CSS transformation of the preceding paragraphs. (IDs 1, 2, 3)</button>

  <h2>CSS Animations</h2>
  <p id="four" class="wiggle"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations">MDN</a>: "CSS Animations is a module of CSS that lets you animate the values of CSS properties over time, using keyframes. The behavior of these keyframe animations can be controlled
    by specifying their timing function, duration, their number of repetitions, and other attributes." The world of CSS animations is huge, and the best place t go see all of the creative things people are doing with CSS animations is CodePen.</p>
