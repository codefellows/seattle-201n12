# Group agreement

Once you've had a chance to talk some as a group, step away from the project planning to develop a group agreement. This is a document that your group creates collaboratively; it details your expectations of how you will work with each other. It is a "living document" - that is, it can be changed as you go along to meet your group's needs as they emerge. Again, develop this collaboratively and write it down together on a whiteboard or in a document. Keep refining it until everyone in the group agrees with it. At the minimum, it should cover:

- Communication plan: How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety, as we learned about in the article on Google and teams and discussing it with Brook?
- Conflict plan: What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?
- Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML portions, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems.
- Git process: What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs?
- Any thing else you feel is important: expectations around work times, standup times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.
