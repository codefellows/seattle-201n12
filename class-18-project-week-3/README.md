# Class 18 - Monday - Project Week: Milestone 3
## Development

1. Start with a meeting to assess how Saturday went, and then plan Monday accordingly.

2. Your goal today: MVP. You want to have everything working, all of your core features in place, and bugs worked out. That will leave tomorrow for stretch goals and focusing on getting the look and feel dialed in to exactly what you want.

Keep in mind, that as we get closer to Friday, it's never too soon to start thinking about presentations, and one step I'd encourage getting to at some point today is to test your project on one of the projectors in the classroom spaces. It just makes everything a little different to be viewed that way. We'll share some specific strategies for presentation prep Thursday morning.
